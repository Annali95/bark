* arf

arf (the advanced recording format) is for storing data from neuronal and
behavioral experiments in a portable, high-performance, archival format. It's
built on the the [[http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/][HDF5]] format, and consists of a set of specifications on how
different kinds of data are stored.

The organization of arf files is based around the concept of an /entry/, a set
of data associated with a particular point in time. An entry might contain one
or more of the following:

+ raw extracellular neural signals recorded from a multichannel probe
+ spike times extracted from neural data
+ acoustic signals from a microphone
+ times when an animal interacted with a behavioral apparatus
+ the times when a real-time signal analyzer detected vocalization

This repository contains:

+ The [[file:doc/specification.org][specification]] for arf
+ A templated C++ interface for reading and writing arf files
+ A python interface for reading and writing arf files (based on [[http://code.google.com/p/h5py/][h5py]])
+ A very rudimentary MATLAB interface

** Dependencies

arf files require HDF5 >= 1.6

The C++ interface requires HDF5 >= 1.8

The python interface requires Python >= 2.6, h5py >= 2.0

** Installation:

+ To install the python package:

: python setup.py install

+ To install the C++ interface:

: scons install

+ To install the MATLAB interface, add the matlab subdirectory to MATLAB's
  search path
