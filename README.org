The Advanced Recording Format (*ARF*) is an open standard for storing data from
neuronal and behavioral experiments in a portable, high-performance, archival
format. The goal is to enable labs to share data and tools, and to allow
valuable data to be accessed and analyzed for many years in the future.

*ARF* is built on the the [[http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/][HDF5]] format, and all arf files are accessible through
standard HDF5 tools, including interfaces to HDF5 written for other languages
(e.g. MATLAB, Python, etc). *ARF* comprises a set of specifications on how
different kinds of data are stored. The organization of ARF files is based
around the concept of an /entry/, a collection of data channels associated with
a particular point in time. An entry might contain one or more of the following:

+ raw extracellular neural signals recorded from a multichannel probe
+ spike times extracted from neural data
+ acoustic signals from a microphone
+ times when an animal interacted with a behavioral apparatus
+ the times when a real-time signal analyzer detected vocalization

Entries and datasets have metadata attributes describing how the data were
collected. Datasets and entries retain these attributes when copied or moved
between arf files, helping to prevent data from becoming orphaned and
uninterpretable.

This repository contains:

+ The [[file:specification.org][specification]] for arf
+ A fast, type-safe C++ interface for reading and writing arf files
+ A python interface for reading and writing arf files (based on h5py).
+ A very rudimentary MATLAB interface

** Project status

ARF is currently in pre-release alpha status for version 2.0.0. There was never
a public release of previous versions. Remaining tasks include:

+ Auto-generate documentation from docstrings in c++ and python code
+ Update MATLAB interface to 2.0 spec.
+ Freeze specification

** Contributing

ARF is under active development and we welcome comments and contributions from
neuroscientists and behavioral biologist interested in using it. We're
particularly interested in use cases that don't fit the current specification.
Please post issues or contact Dan Meliza (dan at meliza.org) directly.

** Installation

ARF files require HDF5>=1.8 (http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5).

The python interface requires Python>=2.6 and h5py>=2.0
(http://code.google.com/p/h5py/). To install the module:

: python setup.py install

To install the C++ interface, you need boost>=1.42 (http://boost.org). In
addition, if writing multithreaded code, HDF5 needs to be compiled with
=--enable-threadsafe=.

: scons install

To install the MATLAB interface, add the matlab subdirectory to MATLAB's search
path.
